This is an audio visualizer built using the three.js Web GL library

Download files into your IDE of choice. Run index.html on a locally hosted server. 

Be aware. Most browsers now disable autoplay. Be sure to enable this feature in order to enjoy the cube.

Feel free to use this code as a starting place for your own visualizers.

Have a great day!
